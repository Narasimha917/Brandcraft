MILESTONE  1:  Environment  Setup  &  AI  Model  Configuration  
This  milestone  establishes  the  core  AI  foundation  for  BizForge  by  installing  required  
dependencies,
 
configuring
 
access
 
to
 
the
 
IBM
 
Granite
 
model
 
hosted
 
on
 
Hugging
 
Face,
 
and
 
setting
 
up
 
the
 
ultra-fast
 
Groq
 
Cloud
 
environment
 
for
 
text
 
generation
 
tasks.
 
Completing
 
this
 
milestone
 
ensures
 
that
 
the
 
BizForge
 
backend
 
can
 
generate
 
creative
 
brand
 
names,
 
marketing
 
content,
 
and
 
chatbot
 
responses
 
using
 
the
 
appropriate
 
AI
 
pipelines.
 
Activity  1.1:  Install  Python  Environment  &  Required  Dependencies  
Before  integrating  branding  models,  the  development  environment  must  be  properly  configured.  
For  Windows  /  Mac  /  Linux:  
1.  Install  Python  3.10+   Download  from:  https://www.python.org/downloads/  Create  and  activate  virtual  environment  
 
Windows:
 
 python  -m  venv  venv 
venv\Scripts\activate  
Mac/Linux:  python3  -m  venv  venv  
source  venv/bin/activate  
2.  Install  core  project  dependencies  pip  install  fastapi  uvicorn  python-dotenv  requests  transformers  groq 3.  Verification:  
Run:  
python  --version  
pip  list 
If  the  environment  is  properly  configured,  the  list  will  include  fastapi,  transformers,  and  groq.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


=== Page 6 ===

 
Activity  1.2:  Configure  IBM  Granite  Model  via  Hugging  Face  BizForge  uses  IBM  Granite-4.0-H-350M  from  Hugging  Face  for  the  AI  Branding  Assistant.  
This  model  provides  strategic  branding  suggestions,  consultative  responses,  and  brand  identity  
guidance.
 
Steps:  
1.  Create  (or  log  in  to)  a  Hugging  Face  account   https://huggingface.co/ 2.  Generate  a  Hugging  Face  Access  Token  ○  Go  to  Settings  →  Access  Tokens  ○  Click  New  Token  →  Read  ○  Copy  the  key  3.  Add  the  key  to  the  BizForge  .env file:  
 HF_API_KEY="your_huggingface_api_key" 
IBM_MODEL="ibm-granite/granite-4.0-h-350m" 
4.  Verify  model  availability:   Visit  model  page:  https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite 
 
 
Activity  1.3:  Set  Up  Groq  Cloud  &  Test  LLaMA-3.3-70B-Versatile  
BizForge  uses  Groq  Cloud  to  run  the  LLaMA-3.3-70B-Versatile  model  for  high-speed  text  
generation
 
tasks
 
such
 
as:
 
●  brand  name  creation  
 ●  product  descriptions  
 ●  email  writing  
 ●  social  media  posts  
 
Groq  is  chosen  for  its  extremely  low  latency  (sub-50ms  response  time)  and  high  throughput.  
Steps:  
1.  Create  a  Groq  Cloud  Account   https://console.groq.com/   2.  Generate  an  API  Key  
  



=== Page 7 ===

 
○  Dashboard  →  API  Keys  →  Create  Key  ○  Add  key  to  .env:  GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_cloud_api_key" 
GROQ_MODEL="llama-3.3-70b-versatile"  
3.  Install  Groq  Python  SDK  (if  not  installed):  pip  install  groq 4.  Test  Connectivity  with  a  Sample  Prompt:  
 
 from  groq  import  Groq 
client  =  Groq(api_key="your_key")  
response  =  client.chat.completions.create(  
 model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile",  
messages=[{"role":  "user",  "content":  "Generate  3  creative  brand  names  for  an  AI  
startup."}]
 
)  
print(response.choices[0].message["content"])  
 
MILESTONE  2:  Core  Backend  Development  
Objective  
Build  the  FastAPI-based  backend  infrastructure  that  powers  all  branding  features  in  BizForge.  
This
 
milestone
 
focuses
 
on
 
creating
 
a
 
modular
 
API
 
structure,
 
implementing
 
AI
 
service
 
utilities
 
for
 
Groq
 
and
 
IBM
 
Granite,
 
integrating
 
the
 
Stable
 
Diffusion
 
XL
 
model
 
for
 
logo
 
generation,
 
and
 
developing
 
the
 
core
 
branding
 
functionality—such
 
as
 
name
 
generation,
 
content
 
creation,
 
sentiment
 
analysis,
 
and
 
chatbot
 
interactions.
 
Activity  2.1:  FastAPI  Application  Initialization  
Create  requirements.txt:  
 


=== Page 8 ===

 
 
Install  Dependencies:  
Open  terminal/command  prompt  and  run:  
>>  python  -m  venv  venv   
>>  venv\Scripts\activate  
>>  pip  install  -r  requirements.txt  
 
Activity  2.2:  Initialize  the  FastAPI  App  in  main.py  
Import  Required  Libraries:  
 
The  main.py file  performs:  
 



=== Page 9 ===

 
●  FastAPI  app  creation  ●  Router  registration  ●  CORS  configuration  ●  Environment  variable  loading  
Install  Required  Dependencies  
All  backend  requirements  were  installed:  
pip  install  fastapi  uvicorn  python-dotenv  transformers  groq  httpx  pillow  
 
Activity  2.3:  Implement  Basic  Input  Processing  &  Validation  
This  activity  focuses  on  creating  the  foundational  input-handling  system  for  BizForge.  Since  the  
platform
 
does
 
not
 
use
 
login
 
or
 
user
 
account
 
profiles
,
 
all
 
branding
 
tools
 
rely
 
directly
 
on
 
user-provided
 
information
 
entered
 
through
 
the
 
frontend.
 
Ensuring
 
the
 
accuracy,
 
structure,
 
and
 
clarity
 
of
 
these
 
inputs
 
is
 
essential
 
for
 
generating
 
high-quality
 
branding
 
outputs
 
from
 
Groq
 
LLaMA
 
and
 
IBM
 
Granite
 
models.
 
The  goal  of  this  activity  is  to  design  a  robust  input-processing  pipeline  that  validates  and  
sanitizes
 
user
 
prompts,
 
prevents
 
errors,
 
and
 
prepares
 
clean,
 
optimized
 
inputs
 
for
 
each
 
AI
 
feature.

Conclusion  BizForge  successfully  demonstrates  the  power  and  practicality  of  Generative  AI  in  solving  
real-world
 
branding
 
challenges.
 
By
 
integrating
 
Hugging
 
Face’s
 
NLP
 
models
 
with
 
a
 
user-friendly
 
web
 
interface,
 
we
 
created
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
suite
 
of
 
tools
 
for
 
startups
 
and
 
entrepreneurs
 
to
 
automate
 
brand
 
ideation
 
—
 
from
 
naming
 
to
 
logo
 
creation,
 
social
 
content
 
drafting,
 
sentiment
 
analysis,
 
and
 
more.
 
Despite
 
the
 
challenges
 
faced,
 
particularly
 
around
 
adapting
 
to
 
API
 
deprecations
 
and
 
migrating
 
from
 
OpenAI
 
to
 
Hugging
 
Face,
 
this
 
journey
 
enabled
 
a
 
deeper
 
understanding
 
of
 
AI
 
model
 
capabilities,
 
backend–frontend
 
integration,
 
and
 
scalable
 
software
 
design.
 
The
 
project
 
also
 
underscored
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
user
 
experience
 
and
 
modular
 
architecture
 
in
 
building
 
robust
 
digital
 
solutions.
 
Looking
 
ahead,
 
BizForge
 
has
 
immense
 
potential
 
to
 
evolve
 
into
 
a
 
commercial-grade
 
branding
 
assistant
 
with
 
premium
 
features
 
like
 
real-time
 
analytics,
 
advanced
 
personalization,
 
and
 
AI-enhanced
 
design
 
tools.
 
This
 
project
 
not
 
only
 
showcases
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
modern
 
AI
 
but
 
also
 
marks
 
a
 
significant
 
milestone
 
in
 
leveraging
 
open-source
 
intelligence
 
for
 
creative
 
automation.
